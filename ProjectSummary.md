Since the data I needed was contained in a single table on the Falcon 9 launch history page, I didn't require the full power and complexity of Scrapy, so I decided to use Beautiful Soup instead of Scrapy for this project because it is easier to use and more beginner-friendly for small-scale web scraping tasks, allows for more manual control when working with simple HTML pages, and allowed me to quickly get started and efficiently gather the data despite requiring setting up an entire scraping structure.
